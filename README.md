# COMP1011 Advanced OOP using Java Assignment 2

The purpose of this assignment is to create an interactive application using the JavaFX library that will allow users to read information from a JSON file.

## Dictionary Application

My application allows a user to enter a word, then builds an http get request that is sent to [wordsapi](https://rapidapi.com/dpventures/api/wordsapi). This API returns information about the word (definitions, part of speech, synonyms, and examples). This data is then written to a JSON file, which is then parsed and displayed to the user using JavaFX.
